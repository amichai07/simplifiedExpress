*the bigest change we did was to change our http to case insensitive - we added a very short method captilizefirst that deals with all that.

it solved almost everything.

few minor changes apart from that 

*we set status to the defualt send(that sends a string);
*in the cookie parser instead of filling the cookies into [] we put {}
*the req.contentType is from headers instead of using the url that works just for static.




we spent more than 50 hours on this ex4 please considre it.
 all the best..
