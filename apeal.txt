*the bigest change we did was to change our http to case insensitive - we added a very short method captilizefirst that deals with all that.

it solved almost everything.

few minor changes apart from that 

*we set status to the defualt send(that sends a string) (miniExpress 122)
*in the cookie parser instead of filling the cookies into [] we put {} 
(miniExpress 364)
*the req.contentType is from headers instead of using the url that works just for static.(miniExpress 160)

we spent more than 50 hours on this ex4 please considre it.
 all the best..
